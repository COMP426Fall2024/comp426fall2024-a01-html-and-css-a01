                The legend of Saci-pererê has existed since the end of colonial times and has its origins in the indigenous tribes of southern Brazil.
                <p>The term “Saci” comes from the Tupi term sa'si, which is related to a bird, which is known by the names “Saci”, “Matimpererê” or “Martim-pererê” (in Tupi: matintape're).</p>
                Initially, Saci was portrayed as a black and devilish character, who had two legs and a tail.
                From the African influence, he loses his leg fighting capoeira and acquires the habit of smoking the pito, that is, the pipe.
                Saci-pererê's little red hat, in turn, comes from folklore in northern Portugal. It was used by the legendary Troll, who possessed supernatural powers.
                <p>The legend is told in all Brazilian regions and, therefore, the story changes depending on the location. In some places, it has different names such as: Saci-Cererê, Matimpererê, Matita Perê, Saci-Saçurá and Saci-Trique.</p>
