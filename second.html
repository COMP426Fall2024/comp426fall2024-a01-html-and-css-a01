       <p><span class="bold">Achilles heel: </span> Another famous story that comes out of the Trojan war is that of Achilles. When Achilles was young his mother dipped him into the river Styx to make him invulnerable. This worked so well that he is stated to have never lost a fight. There was however one spot that he was not dipped into the river and that was his heel where his mother held him while she dipped him in the river. This is why when Achilles rushed into the city of Troy to invade it he was ambushed by an arrow from Paris that shot at his heel. It struck and the most undefeated hero was finally slain.</p>
       <p><span class="bold">The Aftermath: </span>While the Greeks won the war the Gods did not forgive them for their transgressions in starting the war. Many Greek heroes such as Odyseus had a hard time making it back home with many obstacles such as sea monsters and bad weather impeding them. Other heroes upon making it back home were killed by the people they once knew or exiled from their home. Others speculate that Zeus started the war intentionally in order to eliminate some of the many demigods he has created.</p>
