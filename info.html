        <p class="yapping">Once upon a time, there lived an ogre named Shrek. After rescuing 
            Princess Fiona multiple times, Shrek wanted to face a new type of challenge. Shrek realized
            that he longed for something more than a life in the swamp. After reading some books from
            the Fairy Godmother's library, Shrek realized that he had a thirst for knowledge. 
        </p>

        <p class="yapping">One day while reading books at the library, Shrek stumbled across a magical
            book showcasing distant lands. The book contained information about a place called The University
            of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, or UNC for short. It wasn't just any university—it
             was a vibrant community where students from all realms, including humans,
              came to learn and grow. Intrigued by the stories of scholars and the pursuit of knowledge,
               Shrek decided it was time for a new adventure. He was going to study abroad!
        </p>

        <p class="yapping">
            Shrek packed his bags and boarded a flight to RDU airport. In a couple hours, he would 
            step foot unto Chapel Hill and begin his journey abroad.
