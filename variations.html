            <h1>Variations</h1>
            The figure of Iara finds parallels in various cultures around the world, which have their own versions of seductive and dangerous aquatic beings. The comparison between these mythological figures highlights both the singularities of the Mother of Waters and the universal similarities in the ways in which human beings imagine and relate to the natural world.
