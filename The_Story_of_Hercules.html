<h1>The Legend of Hercules</h1>
<p>Hercules is the Roman name for the Greek hero Herakles, the most popular figure from ancient Greek mythology.
    Hercules was the son of Zeus, king of the gods, and the mortal woman Alcmene. Zeus, who was always chasing one woman
    or another, took on the form of Alcmene's husband, Amphitryon, and visited Alcmene one night in her bed, and so
    Hercules was born a demi-god with incredible strength and stamina. He performed amazing feats, including wrestling
    death and traveling twice to the underworld, and his stories were told throughout Greece and later in Rome, yet his
    life was far from easy from the moment of his birth, and his relationships with others were often disastrous. This
    was because Hera, the wife of Zeus, knew that Hercules was her husband's illegitimate son and sought to destroy him.
    In fact, he was born with the name Alcaeus and later took the name Herakles, meaning "Glory of Hera", signifying
    that he would become famous through his difficulties with the goddess.The demi-god, who suffered like mortals and
    who could make a mess of things in life just as easily as any man or woman but perform deeds no mortal could, had
    great appeal for the people of Greece and Rome. Hercules was a kind of super-powered everyman who suffered
    disappointments, had bad days - even bad years - and eventually died due to another's trickery. These stories,
    besides simply being entertaining, would have served an ancient audience by letting them know that, if bad things
    could happen to a hero like Hercules, they had nothing to complain about regarding the disappointments and tragedies
    in their own lives. Hercules served as a symbol of the human condition where, to use Hemingway's phrase, "a man may
    be destroyed, but not defeated." An interesting aspect of Hercules' character is that, because of his divine
    strength and abilities, he did not have to willingly submit to any of the labors or punishments imposed upon him. He
    chose to suffer indignities such as his famous Twelve Labors or his servitude to the queen Omphale and did so
    willingly. His inner strength and ability to endure hardships made him an inspirational figure to the people and a
    symbol of stability in the midst of chaos, even if it was a chaos he himself had caused.

        that the content didn't matter and the assignment is based on the html code. With this in mind, I did some
        googling on the fictional character Hercules and copy and pasted it to my code. I alse added a citation. The
