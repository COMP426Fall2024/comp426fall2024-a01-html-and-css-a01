<h1>Part 1:</h1>
<div>
    <p><span class="bold">The Cause:</span> The conflict started at a feast that Zeus had arranged for King  Peleusâ€™ for his marriage to Thetis. For the feast he invited all the gods except for the goddess of strife, Eris. The goddess was upset by this rebuttal and as she left she flung a golden apple into the crowd with the words for the fairest written on it. Soon after the apple landed in the crowd the goddesses Aphrodite, Athena, and Hera started to fight over who should have the apple. They went to Zeus for him to decide but not wanting to choose he sent them to the Trojan Prince Paris to decide. Once they went to Paris he was unable to decide so the goddesses tried to bribe him instead. Aphrodite's brother was the most beautiful woman in the world Helen of Sparta and upon hearing this Paris declared Aphrodite most beautiful. Helen however was already married to king Menelaus of sparta. This caused Paris to go to Sparta to try and abduct Helen but upon meeting Helen she is shot by cupid with a love arrow and immediately falls in love with Paris.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">The Siege:</span> Upon finding out about his stolen wife Menelaus, got his brother, Agamemnon to gather other great Greek heroes and set out on a voyage to get Helen back. There were many small battles that in total would last about 10 years. This was finished however when the Greeks retreated from their camp outside Troy and left a giant wooden horse behind. The people of Troy debated for a long time if they should bring the horse in finally deciding to let it through the gates. The horse however was hollow in the middle and had the Greek army hidden inside of it. The idea was Odyseuses and to make it more convincing some of the Greek soldiers sailed away the same day. Then they waited for night to come and snuck out  of the horse and took the city of Troy.</p>
