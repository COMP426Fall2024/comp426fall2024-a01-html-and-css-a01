            <p> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; All across the world, regions have tales and stories of their very own mythical little people wandering the area. Some invoke fear in children so that they don't wander where they aren't supposed to. Others depict them as kind and existing in their own space. The common denominator in these specific mytholoogical creatures is that they play games and are mischevious. <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; If you hover on origin in the top right, there will be more details on each region. I have minor stories that you should take with a grain of salt.
