      <!-- Additional description of Charizard -->
      <div class="description">
        <p><strong>Charizard</strong> is a draconic, bipedal Pokémon, primarily orange with a cream underside. It has a long neck, blue eyes, two horn-like structures on its head, and large wings with blue-green undersides. Its arms are short with three white claws, and its tail burns with a flame that intensifies when it’s irritated.</p>
        <p>Charizard inhabits mountains, valleys, and even volcanoes, forming packs with other family members like Charmander. It flies in search of strong opponents, and its fiery breath can melt boulders or glaciers, though it never attacks weaker foes.</p>
        <p>Though it originally couldn’t learn Fly, Charizard has been depicted carrying trainers since early Pokémon artwork. It’s now commonly shown flying trainers to distant locations, with special roles like Charizard Glide in the Alola region.</p>
