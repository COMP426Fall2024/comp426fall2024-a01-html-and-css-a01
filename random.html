        <p class="yapping">As Shrek began registering for classes, Shrek decided that he would study
            computer science. Fortunately, Shrek learned some basic programming and DSA skills from the 
            Fairy Godmother, so he was able to place out of COMP 110 and COMP 210. Shrek registered for 
            some more advanced courses like COMP 211 and COMP 301.
        </p>

        <p class="yapping">At first, the other students and classmates were startled to see an ogre. 
            Shrek was even interviewed by the Daily Tar Heel and made it to the front page of the newspaper. 
            Word of Shrek's adventures and academic pursuits spread far and wide, drawing visitors and scholars. 
            They came seeking the ogre who broke stereotypes and bridged worlds, who found a second home among humans 
            while enriching their community with his diversity and strength of character.
            Days turned into weeks, and weeks turned into months. Through his time abroad,
            Shrek was able to check off everything on his list. He was even able to win the student lottery
            and get a ticket to the Duke vs. UNC basketball game. After UNC won, Shrek even rushed 
            Franklin Street. Other people across Chapel Hill were shocked to see an ogre amongst them, but 
            nobody cared because UNC had just beat Duke. 
        </p>

        <p class="yapping"> On Shrek's 
            final day at UNC, he said goodbye to all his friends. He also bought lots of overpriced 
            merchandise from the student stores to bring back home. As Shrek's time abroad has come to an end, 
            Shrek was excited to go back home. Although he had an 
            amazing time at UNC, he missed his swamp and Donkey. Fortunately for Shrek, he really liked 
            computer science and decided to bring a PC to his swamp and do more coding from there. As he boarded
            the plane back to the Far Far Away, he smiled and wondered what adventures he would experience next.
