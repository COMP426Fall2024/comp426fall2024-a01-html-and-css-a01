        <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
        <p>The Yunwi Tsunsdi, or Little People, are a significant aspect of Cherokee mythology, depicted as small, mystical beings residing in mountain caves. Despite their friendly demeanor, they value their privacy and can become mischievous if disturbed. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="default-div">
        <h2>ORIGIN AND HISTORY</h2>
        <p>The Little People are benevolent creatures who frequently help humans in Cherokee stories, but they have magical powers and are said to harshly punish people who are disrespectful. In Cherokee culture, their stories and mythical creatures are generally told with a moral/lesson in mind for elders or parents to teach children. Like most mythical beings, you aren't supposed to say their name out loud when you're in their home because it can be disrespectful or cause unwanted attention from them.</p>

    <div class="default-div">
        <h2>CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
        <p>The Little People are generally considered to be friendly and helpful, often assisting those in need.They are often heard playing drums in isolated mountain areas, but it is advised not to follow the sound, as they do not appreciate being disturbed at home. If a stranger attempts to approach them, the Little People may cast a spell causing confusion and disorientation, leading the individual to lose their way. Even if the person eventually finds their way back, they may remain in a dazed state, permanently affected by the encounter.</p>

        <h2>STORIES AND ANECDOTES</h2>
        <p>I went to the Cherokee reservation last year and my friend said she saw Little People when we were driving on the parkway. While she didn't know who/what they were nor their story/origin, but yet she said she saw them in the woods. </p>
