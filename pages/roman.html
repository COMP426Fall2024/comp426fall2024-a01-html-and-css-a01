            <p class="r1">In Roman Mythology, Neptune is the ruler of the seas. He is the son of Saturn, and a brother of Jupiter. Like Poseidon, he is known to have a bad temper, and to wield a trident.</p>
            <p class="r2">Like Poseidon, Neptune is the ruler of the seas, earthquakes, and horses; but he is also the god of freshwater bodies.</p>
            <p class="r3">One famous story of Neptune is when Aeneas, the founder of Rome, is being attacked by the goddess Juno, and Neptune sees Aeneas's importance and protects him.</p>
